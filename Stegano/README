		TASK 1

- Iterated through the matrix by simulating C-like for.

- Iterated through the matrix by taking one key at a time

- In the second loop I saved the beginning of the line in case we find
	"revient"

- Decrypted every character and looked for 'revient', then crypted them back

- If found, go to the beginning of the line and display the decrypted 
	characters until we find the string terminator

- If not, repeat the process until we find the word, using every key

- The second parameter helps to solve exercise 2.

		TASK 2

- Decrypted the matrix using the old key

- Positioned myself on the next line after the line with the message
	from exercise 1

- Alterated the matrix by introducing the new message at the right positions

- Calculated the new key, encrypted back the matrix and displayed it

		TASK 3

- Positioned myself at the position given by the function parameter

- Introduced every character of the letter transformed in Morse code
	at right position

- I also introduced the string terminator and displayed the matrix

		TASK 4

- Went ot the right position in the int matrix

- Checked if the current bit of the binary representation of the letter is
	set or not

- If it is, set the last bit of the number in the matrix

- It it is not, clear the last bit of the number in the matrix

- Continue until we found the 8th bit, then go to the next letter and repeat
	the process

- Displayed the matrix

		Task 5

- Went to the right spot in the matrix

- Or operation between the number in the matrix and a mask made out of 1

- If the result is unchanged, this means that the last bit of the number in
	the matrix is set

- We keep the result in eax, so we shift to the right position (using ecx)
	and set the bit of the eax if it is needed

- Go to the next bit and repeat the process util we find the string terminator
	(00000000)

		TASK 6

- Iterated through the matrix using jumps (simulating C for)

- Checked for the position of the element 
	(not to be the first/last line/cloumn) and if the position was right,
	I calculated the elemnt of the matrix using the given formula.

- If the position was not right, I printed the number as it is

Thank you for reading this, I hope everything was clear. Have a nice day :)
